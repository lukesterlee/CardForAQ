# CardForAQ
AQ Card App!

## Introduction

This repo is for making an app for AQ : Farewell/Thank you card for AQ.

This repo is specifically for AQ. For Amy and John, let's create another repo if someone is willing to take the lead.

## Rules

1. Do Not Talk about this except super secured space (a.k.a Telegram :) This should be a big surprise
2. Do Not push other students too much (Of course it would be great to get all 31 students' cards but let's not push too much since we have all different schedules and priorities so let's respect that :) Stress-free project!
3. Do Not Talk about this at C4Q Space!!! Security~ (welcome to King Burger)
4. The order of cards will be either random or Alphabetical
5. Feel free to open up an issue to make suggestions


## Specification

1. Picture of you (so she can always see us :)
2. Message to her (This message goes in CardView)
3. XML file with top parent CardView 
4. Style should be unique. 31 same format cards will be boring.
