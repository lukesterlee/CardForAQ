# CardForAQ
AQ Card App!

## Introduction

This repo is for making an app for AQ : Farewell/Thank you card for AQ.

This repo is specifically for AQ. For Amy and John, let's create another repo if someone is willing to take the lead

## Rules

1. Do Not Talk about this except super secured space (a.k.a Telegram :) This should be a big surprise
2. Do Not push other students too much (Of course it would be great to get all 31 students' cards but let's not push too much since we have all different schedules and priorities so let's respect that :) Stress-free project!
3. Do Not Talk about this at C4Q Space!!! Security~ (welcome to King Burger)


## Specification

1. Picture of you (so she can always see us :)
