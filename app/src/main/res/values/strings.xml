    <string name="message_jose">An aura that can be felt through walls, a smile to be seen from across an ocean, a laugh that resonates through the largest of rooms, and a positive spirit that can uplift the gloomiest of individuals; these are the qualities that make up a person whom is an absolute joy to be around, and these are the qualities I see when I look at you AQ. I\'m ultimately indebted to the universe for creating such a wonderful spirit and to you for all you\'ve done for us. I wish you nothing but the best on this next chapter of your life; and remember this isn\'t goodbye, it\'s "See you later". â™¥  </string>
