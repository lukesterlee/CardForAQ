    <string name="sarah_to_aq_body">When I first met you as the TA next to my table during the HTML/CSS bootcamp, I wish I was at your table. I was amazed at your dedication and support, inspired by your words of encouragement. The more I got to know you, the more I said to myself I want to be like you, a strong-minded and soft-hearted individual. I will miss you dearly but won't be too sad as I know you will be back. In the meantime, let's keep in contact til we meet again in person. À bientôt!!</string>
    <string name="sarah_to_aq_closing">Bien à vous\nSarah H. Kim</string>
