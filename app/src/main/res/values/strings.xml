    <string name="sarah_to_aq_body">When I first met you as the TA next to my table during the HTML/CSS bootcamp, I wish I was at your table. I was amazed at your dedication and support, inspired by your words of encouragement. The more I got to know you, the more I said to myself I want to be like you, a strong-minded and soft-hearted individual. I will miss you dearly but won\'t be too sad as I know you will be back. In the meantime, let\'s keep in contact til we meet again in person. À bientôt!!</string>
    <string name="sarah_to_aq_closing">Bien à vous\nSarah H. Kim</string>

    <string name="johnmessage"> Je l\'ai appris que en tout pays, il y a une lieue de mauvais chemin.
        Que on ne fait pas d\'omelette sans casser des œufs. Mas les petits ruisseaux font les grandes rivieres.
    Les jours se suivent et ne se ressemblent pas. Il n\'y a que les montagnes qui ne se rencontrent jamais. Merci pour tout.
    Au revoir, Alex. Apres la pluie, le beau temps. -John</string>
    <string name="message_jose">An aura that can be felt through walls, a smile to be seen from across an ocean, a laugh that resonates through the largest of rooms, and a positive spirit that can uplift the gloomiest of individuals; these are the qualities that make up a person who is an absolute joy to be around, and these are the qualities I see when I look at you AQ. I\'m ultimately indebted to the universe for creating such a wonderful spirit and to you for all you\'ve done for us. I wish you nothing but the best on this next chapter of your life; and remember this isn\'t goodbye, it\'s "See you later". ♥  </string>
    <string name="jorge">We're all so sad to see you go. I can't believe you are actually leaving. I wish you the best on your new adventures. I hope we get to see you back at C4Q. You will be greatly missed. I also want to thank you because this program is one of the best things that has happened to me. Thanks to you and the whole team, I will be a mobile developer. Thank you for being part of that and helping me accomplish this. Once again, we all love you and we will miss you. \n Best Wishes, \n Jorge Reina</string>
